 Proposed Solution

 Develop a hybrid system using OpenCV and MTCNN that detects faces and analyzes facial dynamics such as blinking, head movements, or micro-expressions. Integrate a deep learning classifier to enhance accuracy and robustness against spoofing attempts. The process includes capturing frames, detecting faces, applying motion or blink-based liveness checks, and using a CNN classifier to verify authenticity in real time. 

Expected Outcome

 The system detects a human face and verifies whether it is live or fake in real time. Detected faces are highlighted, and the result ('Live' or 'Spoof') is displayed on screen, ensuring secure and efficient face-based authentication.
